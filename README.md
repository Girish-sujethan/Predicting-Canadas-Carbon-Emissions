# Predicting Canadas Carbon Emissions
 Uses data from multiple countries and polynomial regression algrothims to predict carbon emmisions in 2050. Also creates a 3D graph to vizualize the last 20 years of Canada's GDP, and Canda's Carbon emissions
We will be using multiple datasets from the same source, the website of data technology company Knoema. The datasets will be in the format of csv, and each dataset will be for a different country. Using the other countries, we will compare and contrast the data from Canada's Data.

For this graph, we will use machine learning regression in python as the dataset we are using is too big for a simple linear regression. We can use enhanced prediction error analysis in plotly to create a better line of best fit which ignores outliers. We can use model.fit() function to train our linear regression function for machine learning.
